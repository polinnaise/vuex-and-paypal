    <h4>MUMMIFICATION</h4>
    <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
    <p>
        Throughout this workshop, you will learn about the smells that defined the mummification
chambers and tombs, and the scents that the ancient Egyptians themselves wished to be
surrounded by in their life after death. In the first hour, Dora will teach you about the olfactory
motivation for mummification and the substances employed during the process. In the second
hour, she will give you a detailed insight into the materials. You will be able to smell each
ingredient and you will learn about their significance for the Egyptians and the reasons behind
their use. In the third and last hour, you will recreate the essence of mummification in a bottle by
using the very same ingredients the ancient Egyptians employed for embalming their dead!
Donâ€™t worry, you will end up with an exceedingly pleasant smell!
