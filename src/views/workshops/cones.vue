    <h4>TEMPLE SCENT</h4>
    <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout this workshop, you will recreate what unguent cones 
    could have looked like in ancient Egypt. In the first hour, Dora will give a lecture on 
    the topic of unguent cones including all the written, archaeological and pictorial 
    evidence. You will discuss theory vs. evidence: What is just a theory and what do we 
    really have evidence for? What was the exact function of unguent cones? 
    What does the written record concerning the sense of smell tell us about these cones? 
    How does the hieroglyphic script and classifier research assist us in understanding the 
    function of these enigmatic artifacts? In the second and third hour, Dora will give you 
    a detailed insight into the ingredients and teach you how to recreate unguent cones. 
    You will do two experiments. These experiments shall demonstrate whether experimental archaeology 
    can help us in finding out more about ancient Egyptian unguent cones.
