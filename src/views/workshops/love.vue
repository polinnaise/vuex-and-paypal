    <h4>LOVEMAKING & SEXUALITY</h4>
    <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout this workshop, you will explore the olfactory world of lovemaking and sexuality in
ancient Egypt. In the first hour, Dora will give a lecture on the topic of scents of lovemaking in
ancient Egypt. You will learn about gods of the Egyptian pantheon related to sexuality through
the sense of smell, such as Amun, Min and Hathor. You will have a look at olfactory symbols of
love in ancient Egyptian love poetry. You will also discuss how one had to smell in order to be
considered attractive in ancient Egypt and what substances the Egyptians used as an aphrodisiac.
In the second hour, Dora will give you a detailed insight into the ingredients. You will be able to
smell each ingredient and you will learn about their significance for the ancient Egyptians. In the
third and last hour, we will recreate the smellscape of lovemaking in ancient Egypt based on the
love poems.
