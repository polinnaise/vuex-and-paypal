    <h4>TEMPLE SCENT</h4>
    <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout this workshop, you will explore the olfactory world of the gods of Egypt 
    and discover the social, cultural and religious value of each scent that was present ancient 
    Egyptian temples. In the first hour, Dora will give a lecture about the fragrant offerings in the temples 
    and reconstruct its overall smellscape. The sufficient written evidence allows for a precise reconstruction of the smell of the temple, 
    which reoccurred on a daily basis in a small, confined space. In the second hour, 
    Dora will give you a detailed insight into the materials. You will be able to smell and taste 
    each temple offering. In the third and last hour, you will recreate the overpowering smell of temples in a 
    bottle, which was one of the most significant scents of ancient Egyptian culture.
