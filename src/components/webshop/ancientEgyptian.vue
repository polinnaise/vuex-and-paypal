    <h4>Ancient Egyptian Smell Kit</h4>
    <p>
      The Ancient Egyptian Smell Kit is based on my PhD research on the sense of smell in ancient
      Egypt and was developed as an educational tool to bring students of Egyptology and the general
      public closer to the ancient Egyptian culture through their nose. The kit includes six of my scent
      reconstructions and a detailed description of the significance of each scent for the ancient
      Egyptian culture. The Ancient Egyptian Smell Kit is a great way to start your olfactory journey
      through ancient Egypt. If this is your first kit and you want to get the most comprehensive one,
      this is the one I would recommend.
