    <h4>KYPHI</h4>
    <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout this workshop, you will learn about all the plants and their intoxicating scents that
surrounded the ancient Egyptians after the inundation of the Nile. You will rediscover the
olfactory landscape of ancient Egypt’s lost orchards and vegetable gardens. Dora will teach you
about flower bouquets presented to gods and kings, flower garlands worn on festive occasions,
aphrodisiacs used during banqueting, and the so-called “garden scent” that was so important to
the Egyptians that they regarded it as an object on its own. In the second hour, Dora will give
you a detailed insight into the materials. You will be able to smell each ingredient and you will
learn about their significance for the Egyptians and the reasons behind their use. In the third and
last hour, you will recreate the refreshing essence of an ancient Egyptian garden in a bottle!
