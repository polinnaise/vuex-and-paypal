    <h4>ONLINE WORKSHOPS</h4>
    <p>
    All workshop topics can be offered online as well. Online workshops take three hours. 
    In the first hour, Dora gives a lecture on the topic of the workshop. In the second hour, 
    she gives the participants a detailed insight into the ingredients with the help of “scent installations”, 
    which they could enjoy through the camera. In the third hour, Dora explains to the participants 
    how they could recreate the scent or smellscape in question or be inspired by it to do something creative at home. 
    Please note that the participants do not have to have the ingredients at home at the time of the workshop. 
    The idea is that during the workshop, the participants learn how to recreate an ancient Egyptian scent, 
    which they could do at home any time at their convenience. 
    The last hour is reserved for Q&A.<br><br>
    Teaching materials, e.g. handouts, are sent via e-mail a day before the workshop. 
    After the workshop, the participants receive a bibliography with articles for further learning. 
    (The bibliography and the articles depend mainly on the questions and interests expressed during the workshop.) 
    If desired, the workshop can also be followed by a  fun quiz with the answers attached, 
    with which the participants can test their knowledge.
